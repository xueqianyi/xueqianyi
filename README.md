## PROJECT & RESEARCH EXPERIENCES
##### WEST CHINA BIOMEDICAL BIG DATA CENTER, SICHUAN UNIVERSITY | INTERN             03/2022 - Present
Project: Optimize the mRNA vaccine sequence algorithm for the covid-19                       
Supervisor: Prof. Xiaobo Zhou
- Investigated a multilingual machine translation model and applied it to the joint translation of the 3'UTR and 5'UTR of mRNA. 
- Redesigned the pre-training task of DNABERT, which could end up with better sequence embedding vectors.
- Inserted the pre-trained DNABERT weights to the bert2bert model for the translation task, which brought the BLEU score to 33.8. Compared with the traditional model without pre-training to test the effectiveness of NLP migration to the DNA translation task.
- Explored parameter sharing in multilingual machine translation.

##### TEAM LEADER | MATHORCUP COLLEGE MATHEMATICAL MODELING CHALLENGE | 04/2021
Project: Exploration ofOptimal Structure Prediction Based on Random Forest and Cluster Geometric Configuration
- Led a team ofthree in project planning, modeling, programming, and paper writing.
- Used the  K-means  algorithm to  cluster  chemical  molecules,  and  results were brought into  SVM  for verification.
- Employed  supervised learning  method to  obtain the  prediction  accuracy to verify the  classification effect.
- Made predictions using random forest models.
- Referred to the  literature to  introduce  auxiliary  quantities  of atomic  density  and  cluster volume to
characterize their influence on energy values.

##### PROJECT LEADER | NATIONAL COLLEGE STUDENT INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
###### PROJECT | SEPT  2020~ APR 2021
Project: Disaster-Prevention-Treasure App
- Served as Project Leader and took charged of needs analysis front-end development.
- Responsible  for  the  writing  of  the  application  form,  which  includes  the  technical  route,  project feasibility, and project planning, and was rated as the first place in the evaluation of the establishment of the project.
- Realized   mobile  terminal   development   based   on   flutter-UI   framework   and   dart   language,   and familiarized with various components and dart syntax.
- Obtained the software copyright of the Disaster-Prevention-Treasure app, which is the outcome of this project.

##### TEAM LEADER | MATHEMATICAL CONTEST IN MODELING (MCM) 2021 | FEB 2021
Project: Beat the Vespa Mandariniz: Interpretation and Exploration ofSighting Report         
- Led a team ofthree in the overall planning, modeling, programming, and paper writing.
- Carried out the construction of the overall rating model, feature value extraction, and data processing. 
- Performed text conversion (tf idf) and used K means for text classification.
- Implemented difference processing on time series data and used ARIMA to make predictions based on
time series to determine ARIMA model parameters.
- In  the  face  of unbalanced  small  samples,  the  sample  size  is  expanded  through  operations  such  as
translation and rotation, and a CNN is built for image classification.
